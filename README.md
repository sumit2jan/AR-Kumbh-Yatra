# AR-Kumbh-Yatra
Just wrapped up my AR Kumbh Yatra project!

Using Unity (2022 LTS), ARCore, LeanTouch, and custom 3D models created in Blender, I built an interactive Augmented Reality experience that brings the cultural essence of the Maha Kumbh Mela into your living room.

The app allows users to explore sacred ghats, boats, and temples, and interact with them through natural gestures like pinch to scale and twist to rotate — all placed seamlessly in the real world through your phone’s camera 📱

🛠️ Key Features: • Real-time plane detection and model placement • Marker-based and markerless AR support • Instant toggle between both modes for flexible exploration • Touch-based scale and rotation using LeanTouch • Optimized for ARCore-supported Android phones • Lightweight, fast, and culturally immersive

🎯 The goal? Use AR to preserve and promote India's cultural heritage in a form that’s accessible, immersive, and fun to experience. Marker:(only for markerBased.. )
